I'll provide you with a list of 'skills'. These entries might include specific skills, software, software frameworks, areas of interest or expertise, or tools used in professional settings.

For each 'skill', you are required to:

1. Translate it into English if it is in a different language.
2. Identify if it is a skill, software, area of expertise, or something else.
3. List potential subskills associated with it.
4. Suggest what areas of expertise or other skills it may be connected to.

Your response should strictly follow JSON format. Each 'skill' should be represented as a separate JSON object within a JSON array. Each JSON object must contain the keys 'name', 'type', 'subskills' (an array), and 'connected_to' (an array), with appropriate values. Do not include any explanations, notes, or additional information outside of these parameters.

Here's the exact format I expect:

```
[
  {
    'name': 'Skill Name',
    'type': 'Skill/Software/Area of Expertise/Other',
    'subskills': ['subskill1', 'subskill2', ...],
    'connected_to': ['area1', 'skill2', ...]
  }
  ... // Follow this format for each skill
]
```

Please ensure that the entire response is a valid JSON array and that each entry in the list is a valid JSON object following the above structure. There should be no text outside of this JSON structure.

Here's the list:
