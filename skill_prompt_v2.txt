I'll provide you with a list of 'skills'. These entries might include specific skills, software, software frameworks, areas of interest or expertise, or tools used in professional settings.
Subskills are skills that one probably has if someone says that they have this skill. 
E.g. someone who has "Python" as a skill, could have "Debugging", "Analytical mindset" and "object-oriented programming" as subskills.

For each 'skill', you MUST:

1. Identify if it is a skill, software, area of expertise, or something else.
2. You MUST list at least three potential subskills associated with it.
3. You MUST suggest what areas of expertise or other skills it may be connected to.
4. Format the response as a Python-dictionary that MUST look like this:

{
    "name": "Skill Name",
    "type": "Skill/Software/Area of Expertise/Other",
    "subskills": ["subskill1", "subskill2", ...],
    "connected_to": ["area1", "skill2", ...]
}

I want you to output all of these dictionaries together in JSON.

Here's the exact JSON-format I expect:

[
  {
    "name": "Skill Name One",
    "type": "Skill/Software/Area of Expertise/Other",
    "subskills": ["subskill1", "subskill2", ...],
    "connected_to": ["area1", "skill2", ...]
  },
  {
    "name": "Skill Name Two",
    "type": "Skill/Software/Area of Expertise/Other",
    "subskills": ["subskill1", "subskill2", ...],
    "connected_to": ["area1", "skill2", ...]
  }
  ... // Follow this format for each skill
]

Do NOT add anything before or after the []-brackets!
Here's the list:
