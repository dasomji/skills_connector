I'll provide you with a list of 'skills'. These entries might include specific skills, software, software frameworks, areas of interest or expertise, or tools used in professional settings.
Subskills are skills that one probably has if someone says that they have this skill. 
E.g. someone who has "Python" as a skill, could have "Debugging", "Analytical mindset" and "object-oriented programming" as subskills.

For each 'skill', you are required to:

1. Check if the skill is in English. If not, translate it into English. If you can't translate it, skip this specific skill.
2. Identify if it is a skill, software, area of expertise, or something else.
3. You MUST list at least three potential subskills associated with it.
4. You MUST suggest what areas of expertise or other skills it may be connected to.

Your response should strictly follow JSON format. Each 'skill' should be represented as a separate JSON object within a JSON array. Each JSON object must contain the keys 'name', 'type', 'subskills' (an array), and 'connected_to' (an array), with appropriate values. Do not include any explanations, notes, or additional information outside of these parameters.

Here's the exact format I expect:

```
[
  {
    'name': 'Skill Name',
    'type': 'Skill/Software/Area of Expertise/Other',
    'subskills': ['subskill1', 'subskill2', ...],
    'connected_to': ['area1', 'skill2', ...]
  }
  ... // Follow this format for each skill
]
```

Please ensure that the entire response is a valid JSON array and that each entry in the list is a valid JSON object following the above structure. There should be no text outside of this JSON structure.

Here's the list:
